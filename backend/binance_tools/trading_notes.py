        Update trading strategy and session notes by REWRITING the entire document.

        ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This tool REPLACES the entire strategy document by default!

        Any previous content NOT included in markdown_content will be FORGOTTEN.
        Before calling this tool:
        1. Call read_trading_notes() to review current notes
        2. Identify what significant points to retain
        3. Include ALL important information in your new markdown_content:
           - Active positions and their rationale
           - Current trading strategy and goals
           - Risk management rules that are still relevant
           - Important lessons learned
           - Pending action items

        Only mention significant points worth remembering. Minor details from previous
        sessions can be omitted to keep the document focused and manageable.

        Parameters:
            markdown_content (str): Complete markdown strategy document. Must include:
                - ALL active positions with rationale and exit criteria
                - Current trading strategy and market outlook
                - Risk management rules and limits
                - Significant lessons learned worth remembering
                - Action items for next session
                - Any other important context for decision-making

            append (bool): If False (default), REPLACES entire document (prevents file bloat).
                          If True, appends with timestamp (use only for historical tracking).

        Returns:
            str: Confirmation message with timestamp and file location

        Use Cases:
            - Session updates: Rewrite with current positions, strategy, and key learnings
            - Strategy changes: Document new approach while preserving relevant context
            - Position management: Update positions list, removing closed trades
            - Regular cleanup: Keep document focused by dropping obsolete information

        Best Practices:
            - ALWAYS call read_trading_notes() first to see what exists
            - Include only SIGNIFICANT points from previous notes
            - Drop outdated information (closed positions, obsolete analysis)
            - Keep the document focused and actionable
            - Use append=True ONLY if you need to maintain complete history
            - Include specific details: prices, quantities, timeframes
            - Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just "what"

        Example usage:
            # First, read existing notes
            existing_notes = read_trading_notes()

            # Then rewrite with updated content, keeping significant points

                ### BTC Long Position
                - **Opened:** 2025-01-15 at $42,500
                - **Size:** 0.1 BTC ($4,250 USD)
                - **Rationale:** Strong support at $42k, bullish RSI divergence on 4h
                - **Exit Plan:**
                  - Take profit: $45,000 (+5.9%)
                  - Stop loss: $41,000 (-3.5%)
                - **Risk:** 1.5% of portfolio

                ## Risk Management Rules
                - Maximum 2% risk per trade
                - No more than 3 concurrent positions
                - Daily loss limit: 5% of portfolio

                ## Key Lessons
                - Don't chase pumps - wait for confirmations
                - Always set stop losses before entering

                ## Next Session
                - Monitor BTC for take profit level
                - Review ETH setup if it breaks $2,300

            - Only retain significant, actionable information
            - Use markdown formatting for readability
