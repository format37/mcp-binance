        Fetch best bid and ask prices with quantities and save to CSV file for analysis.

        This tool retrieves the current best bid (highest buy order) and best ask (lowest sell order)
        prices with their quantities. It's a lightweight alternative to the full order book when you
        only need the top-of-book data for spread monitoring and quick market sentiment analysis.

        Parameters:
            symbol (str): Trading pair symbol (default: 'BTCUSDT')
                Examples: 'BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'BNBUSDT', 'ADAUSDT', 'SOLUSDT'

        Returns:
            str: Formatted response with CSV file info, schema, sample data, and Python snippet to load the file.

        CSV Output Columns:
            - symbol (string): Trading pair symbol
            - bid_price (float): Best bid (buy) price - highest price buyers are willing to pay
            - bid_qty (float): Quantity available at best bid
            - ask_price (float): Best ask (sell) price - lowest price sellers are willing to accept
            - ask_qty (float): Quantity available at best ask
            - spread (float): Price difference between ask and bid (ask_price - bid_price)
            - spread_percent (float): Spread as percentage of bid price
            - mid_price (float): Mid-market price ((bid_price + ask_price) / 2)
            - bid_value (float): Total value at best bid (bid_price Ã— bid_qty)
            - ask_value (float): Total value at best ask (ask_price Ã— ask_qty)

        Understanding Bid/Ask:
            - Bid (Buy side): The highest price a buyer is willing to pay
            - Ask (Sell side): The lowest price a seller is willing to accept
            - Spread: The difference between ask and bid (cost of immediate execution)
            - Mid price: The average of bid and ask (often used as "fair value")
            - Tight spread: Indicates high liquidity and efficient market
            - Wide spread: Indicates low liquidity or volatile conditions

        Market Analysis Use Cases:
            - Spread monitoring: Track spread_percent to assess market liquidity
            - Market sentiment: Compare bid_qty vs ask_qty for buying/selling pressure
            - Liquidity assessment: Large quantities at best prices indicate good liquidity
            - Price discovery: Use mid_price as fair value estimate
            - Entry/exit timing: Check spread before placing market orders
            - Market efficiency: Narrow spreads indicate efficient markets
            - Volatility indicator: Widening spreads often precede volatility

        Trading Strategy Applications:
            - Order placement: Place limit orders between bid and ask to save on spread
            - Market vs limit orders: Use spread_percent to decide order type
            - Slippage estimation: Spread indicates minimum cost of immediate execution
            - Liquidity timing: Wait for favorable bid/ask quantities before trading
            - Market making: Analyze spread for potential profit opportunities
            - Quick sentiment: More bid volume suggests buying pressure
            - Fair price: Use mid_price for valuation and comparison

        Always use the py_eval tool to analyze the saved CSV file for insights such as:
            - Spread cost: spread as absolute value and percentage
            - Market pressure ratio: bid_qty / ask_qty (>1 = buying pressure, <1 = selling pressure)
            - Value imbalance: bid_value vs ask_value comparison
            - Fair value: mid_price calculation
            - Liquidity depth: Total value available at best prices
            - Spread efficiency: Compare spread_percent across different symbols
            - Execution cost estimate: spread / 2 for typical market order cost

        Example usage:
            binance_get_book_ticker(symbol='BTCUSDT')
            binance_get_book_ticker(symbol='ETHUSDT')
            binance_get_book_ticker(symbol='BNBUSDT')

        When to Use This Tool:
            - Quick spread checks without loading full order book
            - Monitoring liquidity at best prices
            - Fast market sentiment from bid/ask quantities
            - Lightweight alternative when rate limits are a concern

        When to Use Other Tools Instead:
            - For full market depth: use binance_get_orderbook
            - For detailed price statistics: use binance_get_ticker
            - For simple price only: use binance_get_price
            - For smoothed price: use binance_get_avg_price

        Note:
            This tool provides only the best bid and ask. For deeper market analysis
            with multiple price levels, use binance_get_orderbook.
