Please demonstrate the trading notes system:

1. First, call binance_get_account to get my current portfolio
2. Then, create initial trading notes using update_trading_notes() that includes:
   - Current portfolio summary (use py_eval to analyze the CSV from step 1)
   - A sample trading strategy
   - Risk management rules
   - Next steps

3. Finally, read back the notes using read_trading_notes() to verify they were saved correctly

This will demonstrate both the trading notes functionality and CSV analysis capability.
