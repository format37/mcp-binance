Please read the current trading notes using read_trading_notes() and tell me:
1. What is the current trading strategy?
2. Are there any open positions mentioned?
3. What are the key action items for the next session?
4. What lessons learned should I be aware of?

If no notes exist yet, that's okay - just let me know.
