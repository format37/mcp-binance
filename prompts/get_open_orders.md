Please call the binance_get_open_orders tool and tell me:
1. How many open orders do I currently have?
2. Which symbols have open orders?
3. What types of orders are open (LIMIT, STOP_LOSS, etc.)?
4. Are there any partially filled orders?
5. What is the total value locked in open limit orders (in USDT)?
