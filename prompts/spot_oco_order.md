NOTE: This is a REAL TRADING operation. Only use for testing with small amounts.

Example test request (DO NOT EXECUTE WITHOUT USER CONFIRMATION):
"I want to place an OCO order to SELL 0.0001 BTC with take-profit at $55,000 and stop-loss at $48,000. Please explain the order and confirm before placing."

After placing the OCO order, please tell me:
1. What is the order list ID?
2. What are the two order IDs (take-profit and stop-loss)?
3. What happens when one order executes?
4. How can I check the status of this OCO order?
5. How can I cancel this OCO order if needed?
