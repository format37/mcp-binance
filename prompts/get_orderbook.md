Please call the binance_get_orderbook tool for ETHUSDT with 50 price levels and tell me:
1. What is the spread between the best bid and best ask prices?
2. How much total volume is available on the bid side vs the ask side?
3. What is the price at level 0 for both BID and ASK sides?
4. Are there any "walls" (unusually large quantities at a single price level)?
5. What percentage of total volume is within 0.5% of the best prices?
