Please call the binance_get_recent_trades tool for BTCUSDT with 200 trades and tell me:
1. What is the ratio of BUY-initiated trades vs SELL-initiated trades?
2. What is the average trade size (quantity) for buy vs sell trades?
3. What is the total volume traded across all 200 trades?
4. What is the price trend (is price generally rising or falling across recent trades)?
5. Are there any unusually large trades (whales) in the data?
