Please call the binance_get_avg_price tool for BTCUSDT, then also call binance_get_price for BTCUSDT.
Compare the two and tell me:
1. What is the average price and what is the current price?
2. What is the deviation percentage between current price and average price?
3. Is the current price above or below the average? What does this suggest about recent price action?
4. What is the time window for the average price calculation?
